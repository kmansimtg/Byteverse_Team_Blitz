<b><h2> About Us </h2></b>
Hey everyone!! Want to know about an interesting and tasty project idea we have come up with ?

Thella...what does this word mean? This means a cart. Yes, we thought about this idea while wandering on streets in search 
of our favorite pani-puri food cart. but we could'nt find that. I am sure that this has happened to you guys too. 
Searching for that particular food cart and that taste will be easier through our app. We will be able to locate 
any food stall or food cart registered on this app named Thella-wala. 

Also, through this app we want to support Indian small scale food sellers who have talent to serve us with tradional 
and regional dishes in such an creative way that we can't even think of. We simply want to be a connecting bridge 
between tourists, locals or any other visitors and that cart ownwer (Thella-wala). 

Reaching to that stall effortlessly will benefit both foodies, i.e., customers of that stall and that cart 
owner in making more money.
